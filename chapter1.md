# Energy Monitoring Application Functionality

First we need to sketch out what the application will actually do!

It will support:

* registration of a user
* activation of new Glow compatible hardware
* login / logout functionality
* a real time widget to display "power now!"
* a set of widgets to navigate through energy consumption
* entry of a tariff \(unit rate and standing charge rate to be applied to the consumption\)
* a setting to change from energy units \(kWh\) to cost units \($ or Â£\)
* calling a Glow analytic feature to get an energy forecast for the next 7 days

Your application should have similar requirements or you should be able to make an analogy of how you are going to use the system and hardware to power your application.

And we need a name ... Glow Energy Application will do for now.
