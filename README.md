# Introduction: Creating a Glow App

A Glow App utilizes the Glow APIs so that IoT devices can work with your own application ideas. For instance, if you want to create a home security application \(web, IOS, etc.\) you can use Glow devices to collect event data \(motion, open doors, features from cameras\) to alert an end user that there has been an intruder. Or if you have a data rich application like energy monitoring, you can plot data history in graphs and use Glow analytics to summarise data into things like costs.

Our example application will be energy monitoring for a home.

The User will be a home owner that has purchased Glow compatible hardware and wishes to use your example application to display their real time energy use and historical consumption.

This application example is a good introduction to Glow APIs, with the idea that you can customize functionality and flows to suite your application needs.
