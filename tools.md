# Tools

We will be using Angular 2 as an example language to implement this tutorial. Don't get too bogged down in Angular 2 issues if you are using a different application framework.

Node version v7.4.0 \(https://nodejs.org/en/\) \(https://www.npmjs.com/\)

npm version 4.1.2

Angular 2 version 2.4.74

Templates that are used are from Bootstrap 4 - which is still under development, but is pretty stable. The version used is 4.0.0-alpha.4
