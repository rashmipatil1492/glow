# Tools

We will be using Angular 2 as an example language to implement this tutorial. Don't get too bogged down in Angular 2 issues if you are using a different application framework.

* Node version v7.4.0 \([https://nodejs.org/en/\](https://nodejs.org/en/\)\)

* npm version 4.1.2 \([https://www.npmjs.com/\](#)\)

* Angular 2 version 2.4.4 \([https://angular.io/\](https://angular.io/\)\)

* Bootstrap 3 - templates that are used are from Bootstrap 4 - which is still under development, but is pretty stable. The version used is 4.0.0-alpha.4 \([https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/\](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/\)\)

You should have a good understanding of working with Restful APIs and know about headers, requests, responses and JSON formats. If you don't - it is easy, but you are not going to learn that here. So find a good online introduction to help you get the feel for creating, reading, updating and deleting \(CRUD\) Restful resources.

It is also pretty necessary to understand node and npm. Angular 2 is less of a dependency, but if you are an Angular ace you can point out the mistakes we have made!

## Third Party Components

Also we have adopted a few framework components to save effort. They are:

* ng2-bootstrap - an Angular 2 module that helps implement all of the Bootstrap "components" that use javascript - for example modals, accordions, carousels, etc.
* Highcharts - a lot of the data that we will be dealing with is time series data. Highcharts is a fantastic javascript chart component and there is an Angular 2 wrapped version that we have included. Be aware - Highcharts is a licensed product so check that you are using the license properly.

## IDE

We have used both the Sublime Editor and Webstorm in our development and they both work fine. Make sure to install the Typescript \(the Angular 2 language\) extensions in your editor of choice

Operating System

All code has been developed on OSX Sierra. Examples should run on other operating systems, but we thought it was important to let you know what we did.

## Browser

Code has been developed with the Chrome browser and loosely tested on Safari.
