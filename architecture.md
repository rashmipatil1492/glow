# Glow Architecture

The Glow architecture is based on a set of API services that your application calls. They are secure over https and use either Basic Auth or JWT for authentication. For your application we will mostly be discussing javascript web tokens \(JWT\) as the Basic Auth is meant for server to server integration for the administration of your application.
